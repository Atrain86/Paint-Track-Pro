# Painting Project Management Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed for managing painting projects. The application provides tools for project estimation, photo management, receipt tracking, and time logging. It's built with a modern tech stack featuring React on the frontend, Express.js on the backend, and PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server framework
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling photo and receipt uploads
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware integration

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless)
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Tables**: Projects, Photos, Receipts, Daily Hours with proper relationships

## Key Components

### Project Management
- Create and manage painting projects with client information
- Track project status (estimating, in-progress, completed)
- Store client preferences and special requirements
- Calculate estimates based on room count and difficulty

### Photo Management
- Upload and organize project photos
- Add descriptions to photos for better organization
- Serve photos through static file middleware

### Receipt Tracking
- Upload receipt files with vendor and amount information
- Track project expenses with date and description
- Support for both digital receipts and manual entry

### Time Tracking
- Log daily hours worked on projects
- Add descriptions for work performed
- Calculate total time investment per project

### Estimation Calculator
- Dynamic estimation based on room count and difficulty level
- Configurable base rates and multipliers
- Save estimates directly to project records

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React frontend makes API calls through TanStack Query
2. **API Layer**: Express.js routes handle authentication and validation
3. **Data Processing**: Drizzle ORM manages database operations
4. **File Handling**: Multer processes file uploads to local storage
5. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to frontend for UI updates

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection**: Uses DATABASE_URL environment variable

### UI Components
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library with Tailwind CSS

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across frontend and backend
- **ESBuild**: Fast production builds for server code
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind and Autoprefixer

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Uses Vite dev server with HMR for fast development
- Runs on port 5000 with proxy configuration
- Automatic server restart on code changes

### Production
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code for Node.js
- Static files: Served directly by Express in production
