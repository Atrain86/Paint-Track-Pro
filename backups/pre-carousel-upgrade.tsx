# Backup before PhotoCarousel upgrade

This is a backup created before implementing the enhanced PhotoCarousel component to replace the old carousel functionality.

The errors are related to old carousel state variables and handlers that need to be removed:
- touchStarted
- longPressTimer  
- isDragging
- dragStart
- dragOffset
- containerRef
- galleryRef
- goToNext/goToPrevious functions

These will be cleaned up and replaced with the new PhotoCarousel component.
