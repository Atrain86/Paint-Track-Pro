# Pre-Zoom Snapshot
**Created**: June 27, 2025 at 5:10 AM  
**Status**: Clean, simple photo viewing - NO zoom/crop functionality

## What This Snapshot Contains
This backup preserves the working photo system BEFORE any zoom or crop features were added.

## Why This Backup Exists
- User tried implementing zoom/crop with react-easy-crop
- Complex cropping broke basic photo viewing functionality
- Had to revert to this simple, reliable version
- This backup ensures we can always return to working state

## What Works in This Version
✓ **Photo thumbnails**: Click to view full-screen  
✓ **Navigation**: Arrow buttons + thumbnail strip  
✓ **Upload**: Two-button interface (Photos/Files)  
✓ **Clean UI**: No confusing crop buttons  
✓ **Reliable**: 9 photos displaying correctly  

## Key Files in This Backup
- `clean-photo-grid.tsx` - Main photo component (WORKING VERSION)

## Instructions for Future Development
1. **ALWAYS test** new features without breaking basic photo viewing
2. **Use this backup** if photo viewing gets broken again
3. **Build incrementally** - add features without removing working functionality
4. **Name is memorable** - "pre-zoom" indicates no zoom features yet

## Restoration Command
If photo viewing breaks again, copy this file back:
```bash
cp backups/pre-zoom-snapshot/clean-photo-grid.tsx client/src/components/clean-photo-grid.tsx
```
