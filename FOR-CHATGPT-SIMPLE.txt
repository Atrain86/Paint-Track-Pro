## THE EXACT ERROR AND SOLUTION FOR CHATGPT

ERROR: Cannot access 'totalCompressedSizeBytes' before initialization at line 427 in StreamlinedClientPage.tsx

The photo upload works perfectly on the server (908KBâ†’177KB compression, saves to database as ID 149), but the UI crashes due to a JavaScript temporal dead zone error.

PROBLEM: State variables are declared AFTER the mutations that use them.

SOLUTION: Move ALL state variable declarations to the TOP of the component (after queryClient) and BEFORE any mutations.

The specific fix is to move this line from around line 427 to the top:
const [totalCompressedSizeBytes, setTotalCompressedSizeBytes] = useState(0);

Here's the working imageCompression.ts file (NO CHANGES NEEDED):

---imageCompression.ts---
