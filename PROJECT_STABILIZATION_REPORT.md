# PaintBrain7 Project Stabilization Report

## Asset Management
- Consolidated logo files
- Removed duplicate logo from `/src/assets/paint-brain-logo.png`
- Confirmed single logo at `/client/public/paint-brain-logo.png`

## Logo References
Updated logo references to use absolute path: `/paint-brain-logo.png`
- Verified in components:
  * AFrameLogo
  * LoginPage
  * ClientListHomepage

## ESLint Cleanup
- Ran `npm run lint -- --fix`
- Remaining issues:
  * 324 errors
  * 6 warnings

### Key Remaining Lint Issues
1. Unused Imports and Variables
   - Multiple components have unused imports
   - Recommended: Remove or use imported variables

2. Type Safety
   - Extensive use of `any` type
   - Recommendation: Replace with specific TypeScript types

3. React Hook Warnings
   - Conditional hook calls in some components
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect/useCallback

## Development Server
- Port changed from 5173 to 5174 due to port conflict
- Potential 404 errors observed during initial launch

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Manually address remaining ESLint warnings
   - Remove unused imports
   - Replace `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Fix hook dependency arrays
2. Conduct thorough code review
3. Implement stricter TypeScript configuration
4. Investigate and resolve 404 resource loading
5. Consider adding React Hook linting rules

## Performance and Stability Notes
- Project uses React 18.3.1
- React Router v6.30.1
- Vite as build tool
- Development server running on port 5174

## Potential Refactoring Opportunities
- Standardize component import/export patterns
- Implement more consistent type definitions
- Review and optimize hook usage
- Resolve resource loading issues

## Verification Status
- Logo consolidation: ✓ Complete
- Asset path standardization: ✓ Complete
- Initial lint cleanup: ✓ Partial
- Development server launch: ✓ Partial (404 errors present)
