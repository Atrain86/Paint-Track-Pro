*Created: June 27, 2025 at 5:05 AM*

## Summary
Photo viewing functionality has been successfully restored to working state. The app now has clean, simple photo management without any complex cropping features that were causing issues.

## What's Working ✓
1. **Photo Upload**: Two-button interface (Photos/Files) working perfectly
2. **Photo Display**: Grid layout with 9 photos currently stored in project 1
3. **Photo Viewing**: Click thumbnail → full-screen viewer with navigation
4. **PDF Upload**: Files button uploads PDFs to receipts table successfully  
5. **PDF Display**: PDFs show in SimpleFilesList with delete functionality
6. **Database**: PostgreSQL with all photos and receipts properly stored
7. **Navigation**: Arrow buttons and thumbnail strip in photo viewer
8. **Upload Interface**: Simplified two-button design as requested

## Current Photo Viewer Features

- Clean black overlay with white controls

- `shared/schema.ts` - Database schema supports photos and receipts

## Database State
- **Project 1**: 9 photos successfully stored and displaying

## What Was Removed
- React-easy-crop library integration (was causing UI conflicts)

4. **Two-button upload**: Photos and Files buttons clearly separated

## Ready for Enhancement
The photo viewing system is now stable and ready for careful, incremental improvements. Any future enhancements should be:
- Built incrementally
- Tested thoroughly before integration
- Designed to not interfere with basic photo viewing
- Backed up before implementation

## User Feedback
