AGENT HANDOFF: Fix File Display Bug in Painting Project App

Project Context:
You're working on "A-Frame Painting" - a React/Express painting business management app. The upload system works perfectly (photos and PDFs save to database), but uploaded files don't display in the UI.

Immediate Problem:
PDF files upload successfully but don't appear in the file list. Root cause identified: Frontend query returns wrong data type.

Key Evidence:
- Database: 9 PDF receipts stored (confirmed working)
- Backend API: GET /api/projects/1/receipts returns correct receipt data
- Frontend Query: Returns project objects instead of receipt objects
- Console Debug: "SimpleFilesList - receipts:" [{"id":1,"clientName":"","address":"","projectType":"exterior"...}]

Technical Stack:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TanStack Query + Wouter
- Backend: Express.js + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- UI: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

Critical Files:
- client/src/components/StreamlinedClientPage.tsx (lines 10-25: SimpleFilesList component)
- DEBUG-SNAPSHOT.md (complete technical details)
- replit.md (project context and user preferences)

User Expectations:
- Simple, clean interface (user prefers minimal complexity)
- Files should appear immediately after upload
- Two-button upload system: Photos (burnt orange) + Files (vintage blue)

The Fix Needed:
Resolve why the query queryKey: ['/api/projects', projectId, 'receipts'] returns project data instead of receipt data. Backend works correctly - this is a frontend query/routing issue.

Workflow to Test:
1. Navigate to project 1
2. Click Files button
3. Upload PDF
4. File should appear in list with "View" link

Important Notes:
- Don't break existing photo upload (works perfectly)
- Follow user preferences in replit.md 
- App uses port 5000 with workflow "Start application"
- Database already contains test data to verify fix

Start by checking the query configuration and data flow between backend and frontend.
