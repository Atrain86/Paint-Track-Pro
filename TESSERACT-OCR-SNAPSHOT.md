# Tesseract OCR Integration Snapshot
*Created: July 2, 2025 - 7:53 AM*

## Current State Before OCR Changes

### Working System Status
- **App Status**: Fully functional with photo upload, receipt management, invoicing
- **OpenAI Integration**: Hit quota limits (429 errors), fallback system in place
- **Upload System**: Working with compact button design (py-3)
- **Photo Management**: 1 photo stored in project 16, carousel working
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with all tables functional

### New Tesseract Integration

#### Benefits of Tesseract.js
1. **Local Processing**: No API costs, runs entirely in browser
2. **Reliable OCR**: Works without network dependencies
3. **Privacy**: No data sent to external services for base OCR
4. **Quota-Free**: Unlimited usage without rate limits

#### Cost Analysis

**Current OpenAI Costs (PROBLEMATIC)**
- GPT-4o Vision API: ~$0.01-0.02 per image
- Rate limited: Hitting quota frequently
- Error rate: High due to quota exhaustion

**New Tesseract + Selective GPT Approach (COST EFFECTIVE)**
- Tesseract OCR: $0 (runs locally in browser)
- GPT-4 text enhancement: ~$0.001-0.002 per request (much cheaper than vision)
- Fallback gracefully when GPT quota exceeded
- Estimated 90%+ cost reduction

#### Technical Implementation
- **Primary**: Tesseract.js for OCR text extraction
- **Enhancement**: Optional GPT-4 text parsing (not vision)
- **Fallback**: Basic regex parsing when GPT unavailable
- **User Control**: Manual review and confirmation before upload

### Pre-Change File States

#### ReceiptUpload.tsx (NEW VERSION)
- Replaced OpenAI Vision API with Tesseract.js
- Added two-stage process: OCR → GPT enhancement
- Maintained same UI/UX with better reliability
- Added raw OCR text viewing for debugging

#### server/openai.ts (CURRENT)
- Has OpenAI Vision API implementation
- Currently hitting rate limits
- Needs new text-only endpoint for enhancement

#### server/routes.ts (CURRENT)
- Has `/api/receipts/ocr` endpoint for image processing
- Needs new `/api/receipts/ocr-text` endpoint for text enhancement

### Expected Changes Needed

1. **Add text-only OCR enhancement endpoint**
2. **Update OpenAI service for text parsing instead of vision**
3. **Test new workflow: Photo → Tesseract → GPT text parse → Upload**

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Tesseract.js is stable, well-tested library
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing uploads continue working
- **Cost Savings**: Major reduction in API costs
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback

### Current Working Features (PRESERVE)
- Photo uploads and display ✓
- Receipt file uploads ✓
- Invoice generation ✓
- Daily hours tracking ✓
- Project management ✓
- Email functionality ✓

## Recommendation
Proceed with Tesseract integration as it provides:
- 90%+ cost reduction for OCR processing
- Better reliability without quota issues
- Same user experience with enhanced error handling
- Local processing for privacy and speed
